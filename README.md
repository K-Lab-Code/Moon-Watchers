# Moon Watchers

## Description
This is an an interactive full-stack application that tells you the moon phase and weather of a specific date and location inputted by the user. It utilizes two server side API's, React, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize.
This was made in collaboration with students taking a full stack web development course over the period of two weeks.
This application solves the problem of wanting to know what moon phase will show on a certain date while also showing the visibility of the night sky on said date.
